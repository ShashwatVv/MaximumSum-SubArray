# MaximumSum-SubArray
Maximum Sum Sub array using tuple-unpacking in c++.
One of the fun facts associated with this divide and conquer approach is:
If each of the elements of the original array is negative, this MaxSumSubARRAY algorithm will return the maximum among the elements of the array.
There exists another non_recursive linear_time algorithm for the same.
